JASMINE
=======


Jasmine is a plugin for unit tests for java script. For some js file
you have to create js file with suffix "Test". For instance:
- script.js
- scriptTest.js

Jasmine has built some test methods which you can use (for instance assert()).

You have to exclude these files which you don`t want to check by Jasmine.
For instance JQuery. But on the other hand you have to add this file 
as preloaded sources if you want to use them in you tested js file.



SAGA
====


Saga is a plugin for test coverage. You can use it later in Sonar.
